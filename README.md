# Outlier Detection Model Comparison

This project compares the performance of several machine learning models for outlier detection in datasets. The goal is to understand how different classifiers handle outlier detection using multivariate data.

## Project Overview

The notebook included in this repository demonstrates the following:

- **Data Preparation**: Preprocessing data for model training and evaluation.
- **Model Selection**: Several machine learning algorithms are applied to the dataset for comparison:
  - Isolation Forest
  - Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
  - One-Class SVM
  - Robust Covariance
- **Visualization**: Graphical comparison of model performance, including decision boundary visualization for each model.
  
The code is primarily designed to handle multivariate datasets and assess outlier detection accuracy by visualizing classification boundaries and performance metrics.

## Key Features

- **Model Comparison**: The project compares the effectiveness of different outlier detection models.
- **Visualization**: Each modelâ€™s performance is visualized with decision boundaries and error metrics.
- **Modular Design**: The models are implemented in a modular way, making it easy to add or remove classifiers for comparison.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/outlier-detection-model-comparison.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the notebook and run all cells:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Compare\ All\ Models.ipynb
   ```

4. The notebook will preprocess the data, train the models, and output the comparison visualizations.

## File Descriptions

- **Compare All Models.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook that contains the model fitting, evaluation, and visualization code.

## Results

The notebook produces visualizations of model performance, showing decision boundaries and the number of errors detected by each outlier detection model.
